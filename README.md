- Classifier

In this part, we set the throttle at a stable value, only control the steering of donkey car, tranfered original autonomous driving problem to classification problem, that is, we trained a model, take the images captured by camera as input, output binary steering value (-1 to make car turn left, 0 to make car go straight).

Future:
- Regression model
- Transfer Learning
